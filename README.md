## Testing

- The website has been tested and is working on all different screen sizes

## Validator Testing
- HTML
  - The W3C validator origionally showed that there was an extra closing </i> tag in all the social media icons but after this was fixed showed no additional errors
- CSS
  - The W3C validator showed no errors in the CSS file

## Bugs and Issues
 - The main issue on the site was the text over the images when scaling down in viewport sizes. The images on the wesite are quite dark so white text was appropriate but as the screen size scaled down the text moved over some lighter parts of the image and became hard to read. Lots of fixes were tried like including filtering the image to become darker and applying a darker box around the text to make the text stand out. In the end the brightness was reduced in the background image and the white text was given a black border using text-shadow to make it stand out even if it did pass over a lighter part of the image.

 ## Accessibility
 - The accessibility of the website was tested using lighthouse and got a score of 100
